/**
 * A twinoid is defined to be an array that has exactly two even values that are adjacent to one another.
 * For example {3, 3, 2, 6, 7} is a twinoid array because it has exactly two even values (2 and 6) and they are adjacent to one another.
 * The following arrays are not twinoid arrays.
 * {3, 3, 2, 6, 6, 7} because it has three even values.
 * {3, 3, 2, 7, 6, 7} because the even values are not adjacent to one another
 * {3, 8, 5, 7, 3} because it has only one even value.
 * Write a function named isTwinoid that returns 1 if its array argument is a twinoid array. Otherwise it returns 0.
 * If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is
 * int isTwinoid (int [ ] a);
 * If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is
 * int isTwinoid(int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array.
